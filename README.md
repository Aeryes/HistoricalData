# HistoricalData
This project uses historical stock data to determine basic trends.

In the main.py under the consumer_key variable file your own personal developer key will need to be used. You can get this from your TD Ameritrade account.
Visit https://developer.tdameritrade.com/content/getting-started for more information.

By changing the symbol paramater in ```self.SPY_historical_URL = self.historical_data_general.format(symbol='SPY')``` which can be found in main.py you can get data on other tickers.
